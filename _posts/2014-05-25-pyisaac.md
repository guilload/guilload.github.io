3 months ago, I discovered an algorithm called [ISAAC](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html){:target="_blank"} on [reddit](http://redd.it/1xl7yc){:target="_blank"}. ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator ([CSPRNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator){:target="_blank"}) designed in 1996 by [Bob Jenkins](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/){:target="_blank"}. It produces 32-bit unsigned integers uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable. Cycles are guaranteed to be at least 2<sup>40</sup> values long and they are 2<sup>8295</sup> values long on average. The generator runs fast and performs on average 18.75 machine cycles.

I had wanted to write my first Python extension for a long time and the short [C implementation](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html){:target="_blank"} combined with a simple API, solely composed of two functions, one for initializing the generator, one for generating random numbers, made ISAAC a great candidate for this task.

#### Writing Python extensions is easy

Given my inexperience, this post is not going to be an umpteenth tutorial about writing extensions, I would rather link you toward resources I found useful for this purpose. However, I would like to point out how easy it is to write extensions: Python’s documentation is clear, extensive and provides a great example that guides you step by step. In addition, the C API is simple and well documented too. This makes writing extensions a very pleasant experience.

Here's what you need to get started:

*   [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html){:target="_blank"}, Python's official documentation;
*   [Python Extension Programming with C](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_further_extensions.htm){:target="_blank"}, Tutorials Point;
*   [Python modules in C](http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions/){:target="_blank"}, Dan Foreman-Mackey.

The rest depends on your C skills. Hello, segmentation fault!

#### Code

Since, I’m a very fancy guy, I named the package... drum roll... "*pyisaac*"! The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/guilload/pyisaac) under MIT license. I’m far from being a C expert, comments and PR are very welcome. The package is hosted on PyPI and can be installed via `pip` or `easy_install`:

{% highlight sh %}
$ pip install pyisaac
$ easy_install pyisaac
{% endhighlight %}

#### Use

As for the original implementation, the API is dead simple:

{% highlight python %}
>>> import pyisaac
>>> pyisaac.random()
0.3417196273803711
>>> pyisaac.seed('pyisaac')
>>> pyisaac.random()
0.9284197092056274
{% endhighlight %}

#### Implementation

##### seeding routine

Bob Jenkins provides no official seeding routine for the algorithm. At first, as [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1xl7yc/isaac_a_pseudorandom_number_generator_thats/cfccplq){:target="_blank"} by redditor [BonzaiThePenguin](http://www.reddit.com/user/BonzaiThePenguin){:target="_blank"}, I used 1024 bytes of data from `/dev/random`. Since this source of randomness is potentially blocking (more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=/dev/random){:target="_blank"} and [there](http://linux.die.net/man/4/random){:target="_blank"}) and not cross-platform, I've decided later on to rely on Python `os.urandom()`. On a UNIX-like system this function will query `/dev/urandom` and on Windows it will use [`CryptGenRandom()`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptGenRandom){:target="_blank"}. If no randomness source is found, the algorithm is seeded from the system time and **then MUST NOT be used for cryptographic purposes**.

##### when unsigned long integers were short

I have slightly modified the original file [standard.h](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/standard.h){:target="_blank"}. ISAAC relies on 4-byte integers arithmetic. Back in 1996, unsigned long integers were 4-byte long but nowadays, they are an 8-byte quantity on 64-bit processors. So I replaced them with unsigned integers instead.

##### mapping integers to floats in [0, 1]

ISAAC generates random integers ranging from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1. In theory dividing them by 2<sup>32</sup>-1 should produce distinct floating point numbers between 0 and 1. In practice, this doesn't work very well, as illustrated by the following C code snippet:

{% highlight C %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    float a, b, c, ONE = 1.0;
    unsigned int MAXUINT = 0xFFFFFFFF;

    a = 0xFFFFFF01 / (float)MAXUINT;
    b = 0xFFFFFF02 / (float)MAXUINT;
    printf("%d\n", a == b);

    c = 0xFFFFFF80 / (float)MAXUINT;
    printf("%d\n", ONE == c);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Output:

{% highlight sh %}
1
1
{% endhighlight %}

This behavior is related to how [floating point numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point){:target="_blank"} are represented. The precision offered by the float type is not enough to account for the infinitesimal increment between `a` and `b` and causes collisions.

##### double to the rescue

To circumvent this problem, *pyisaac* relies on the double type. A double is 64-bit long whereas a float is 32-bit and is sufficiently accurate to map each integer to a distinct floating point number between 0 and 1.

##### one and one makes two

This approach presents a drawback: the generated double have a 32-bit resolution and do not make the most of the extra precision brought by the double type. I've taken a look at how CPython random generator is implemented and the core developers came out with an elegant solution: two 32-bit random numbers are generated in order to "fill" one double and achieve 53-bit resolution:

{% highlight C %}
/* generates a random number on [0,1) with 53-bit resolution; note that
 * 9007199254740992 == 2**53; I assume they're spelling "/2**53" as
 * multiply-by-reciprocal in the (likely vain) hope that the compiler will
 * optimize the division away at compile-time.  67108864 is 2**26.  In
 * effect, a contains 27 random bits shifted left 26, and b fills in the
 * lower 26 bits of the 53-bit numerator.
 */
static PyObject *
random_random(RandomObject *self)
{
    unsigned long a = genrand_int32(self) >> 5, b = genrand_int32(self) >> 6;
    return PyFloat_FromDouble((a * 67108864.0 + b) * (1.0 / 9007199254740992.0));
{% endhighlight %}

Neat, isn't it?

#### Testing

##### testing the implementation

Bob Jenkins provides a seed and the first 2600 random numbers generated from it. *pyisaac* is tested against these numbers and get them right... but this only means the implementation is right, not that the algorithm generates truly uniformly distributed, unbiased and unpredictable numbers.

##### testing the algorithm

In fact, it is impossible to give a mathematical proof that a generator is indeed a random bit generator, as a consequence, generators are submitted to batteries of statistical tests which aim to detect certain kinds of weaknesses such as: 

* shorter than expected periods for some seed states;
* lack of uniformity of distribution for large amounts of generated numbers;
* correlation of successive values, etc.

[Dieharder](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php){:target="_blank"} is an example of such a battery of tests. ISAAC successfully passes all the [Diehard](http://stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard/){:target="_blank"} and [NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/index.html){:target="_blank"} statistical tests. Both these test suites are part of Dieharder.

#### Performance

Let's get a rough sense of how *pyisaac* performs compared to `random.random()` from the standard library and `numpy.random.rand()`. These PRNGs implement the [Mersenne twister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister){:target="_blank"} algorithm:

<img alt="PRNGs benchmark" src="/assets/media/pyisaac/benchmark.png">

As can be seen, *pyisaac* runs within the same order of magnitude. And... yes... Python adds much overhead compared to the native implementation... But starting a flame war is not the point of this post :)

That's all folks! I'd like to thank Mike McFadden who gave me [valuable advice](https://github.com/guilload/pyisaac/issues/1){:target="_blank"} on how to seed the generator properly.
